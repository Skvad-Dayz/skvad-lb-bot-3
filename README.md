## Discord Permissions

> This is not the permission level required to execute actions or run commands, like User, Moderator or Administrator

Invite the bot to your server by navigating to the following URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with `CLIENT_ID` from the `/config/.env` file):

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

Any command can be used without any Discord permissions, as long as the bot is invited to your server with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes. You can use the template url above, or alternatively, generate an invite link in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (Your App > OAuth2 > URL Generator > `scopes: bot + applications.commands`)

`AUTOMATIC_LEADERBOARD_MODULE`: This requires the following permissions in any channel this module is assigned to: `View Channel`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, and `Embed Links`
