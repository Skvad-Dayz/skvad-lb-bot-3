## Discord Permissions

> This is not the permission level required to execute actions or run commands, like User, Moderator or Administrator

Invite the bot to your server by navigating to the following URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with `CLIENT_ID` from the `/config/.env` file):

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

Any command can be used without any Discord permissions, as long as the bot is invited to your server with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes. You can use the template url above, or alternatively, generate an invite link in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (Your App > OAuth2 > URL Generator > `scopes: bot + applications.commands`)

`AUTOMATIC_LEADERBOARD_MODULE`: This requires the following permissions in any channel this module is assigned to: `View Channel`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, and `Embed Links`

## Server Configuration

All server configuration is done in `config/servers.js`. Multiple servers are supported. The server configuration file is created during the installation and usage steps. Below is detailed information on what the settings do.

```js
  {
    // Server data
    // Global display name in Discord
    NAME: 'My Server ðŸ˜Ž',
    // Your server api id - make sure to "grant access" through the link displayed
    // in the cftools developer portal
    CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID: 'YOUR_SERVER_API_ID',
    // Your DayZ server IP
    SERVER_IPV4: '0.0.0.0',
    // Your DayZ Game port
    SERVER_PORT: 2302,

    // Command Configuration
    // Include the zones heatmap image in the /statistics command
    // Fixes issues using the command where Chromium dependencies can't be resolved
    STATISTICS_INCLUDE_ZONES_HEATMAP: true,
    // Keep the Puppeteer Chromium browser open - this generates the
    // heatmap WAY faster, but uses more RAM (~+20 MB)
    STATISTICS_KEEP_PUPPETEER_BROWSER_OPEN: true,
    // Include mod list in /server-info
    SERVER_INFO_INCLUDE_MOD_LIST: true,

    // Global Leaderboard
    // How many players to display - min 10, max 100
    LEADERBOARD_PLAYER_LIMIT: 25,
    // Players to exclude from leaderboard
    LEADERBOARD_BLACKLIST: [
      '6284d7a30873a63f22e34f34',
      'CFTools IDs to exclude from the blacklist',
      'always use commas (,) at the end of the line EXCEPT THE LAST ONE > like so'
    ],
    // What stats should be enabled in the leaderboard
    LEADERBOARD_STATS: [
      'OVERALL',
      'KILLS',
      'KILL_DEATH_RATIO',
      'LONGEST_KILL',
      'PLAYTIME',
      'LONGEST_SHOT',
      'DEATHS',
      'SUICIDES'
    ],

    // Automatic Leaderboard - A module that sets a channel as
    // dedicated, always up-to-date leaderboard feed
    // Should we automatically update/post the leaderboard
    AUTO_LB_ENABLED: true,
    // The id of the channel to post the leaderboard
    AUTO_LB_CHANNEL_ID: '806479539110674472',
    // Time between messages in minutes
    AUTO_LB_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES: 60,
    // Should we delete our old messages
    // Also deleted other bot messages, like commands
    AUTO_LB_REMOVE_OLD_MESSAGES: true,
    // Amount of players to display on automatic leaderboard
    AUTO_LB_PLAYER_LIMIT: 100,
    // The stat to rank players by in auto leaderboard module
    // One of LEADERBOARD_STATS
    AUTO_LB_STAT: 'SUICIDES'
  }
```

To add a second, or more, servers - copy-paste your entire server block and modify the configuration. Afterwards, make sure your syntax is still valid:

```
[
  {
    ...
  }, <-- Notice the comma - always add this when adding a new server block
  {
    ...
  }
]
```

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- A CFTools [developer application](https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications)
  - Make sure you navigate to the "Grant URL" that's displayed and authorize access to your server & resources (ban lists for example)
- A [Discord Bot account](https://discord.com/developers/applications "Discord Developer Portal")
    1) Head over to the page linked above
    2) Click "New Application" in the top right
    3) Give it a cool name and click "Create"
    4) Click "Bot" in the left hand panel
    5) Click "Add Bot" -> "Yes, do it!"
    6) Click "Reset Token" and copy it to your clipboard, you will need it later
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node official website") (if you're running as a plain NodeJS app)
    1) Head over to the download page
    2) Download the latest LTS build available for your OS
    3) Be sure to check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" when you're running the installation wizard
- [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), if you want to use `/statistics` hit-zone heat-maps (can be disabled)
  - Comes with most Windows installations, if not - [download](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) the application
  - `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser` for most Linux distributions, or use your distro's apt-alternative (package manager) - if this doesn't work you might have to point `puppeteer` to your browser executable
  - `brew install chromium && which chromium` on Mac OS

### Run as a Docker container (preferred)

The quickest and easiest way to host/use this bot is by deploying it inside of a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ "Official Docker Website") container.

> *A [**docker-compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "View docker-compose documentation") file is included for your convenience*

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot.git`
2. Navigate inside the new folder: `cd cftools-discord-bot`
3. Rename `/config/.env.example` to `.env` and provide your environmental variables
4. Rename `/config/config.example.js` to `config.js` and provide your bot configuration
5. Rename `/config/servers.example.js` to `servers.js` and provide your server configuration
    - Alternatively, you can now use the `docker-compose up` command to finish setting up the project if you have the [Docker Compose CLI](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
6. Build the project: `docker build --tag my-discord-bot .`
7. Start the bot: `docker run -it --env-file .env --name my-discord-bot mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot:main`

### Run as a plain NodeJS app

You can also clone this repository or download a release, and host the project directly. You will need [Node/NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node official website") (Be sure to check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" when you're running the installation wizard)

1. Head over to [the download page](https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot/releases/)
    - Alternatively, clone this repository by using `git clone https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot.git` and skip to step 4 if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Download Section") installed
2. Download either the `zip` or `zip.gz` source code
3. Extract it using [your favorite zip tool](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm "It's WinRar, duh")
4. Open a new console/terminal/shell window in the newly created project folder
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
6. Rename [`/config/.env.example`](/config/.env.example "View .env.example file in current repository") to `.env` and configure your environmental variables
7. Rename [`/config/config.example.js`](/config/config.example.js "View config.example.js file in current repository") to `config.js` and go through your bot configuration
8. Rename [`/config/servers.example.js`](/config/servers.example.js "View servers.example.js file in current repository") to `servers.js` and go through your server configuration
9. Use the command `node .` to start the application, or alternatively:
    - `npm run start` to keep the process alive with [PM2](https://pm2.io/ "PM2 | Official Website"), suitable for production environments. (`npm i -g pm2` to install)
    - `npm run start:dev` if you have `nodemon` installed for automatic restarts on changes, suitable for development environments
